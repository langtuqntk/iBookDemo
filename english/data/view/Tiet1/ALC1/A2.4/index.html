            Some people say that a place of interest is a place famous for
            its scenery or a well-known (1)<span id="droppable" class="droppable ui-widget-header"></span> site. I don’t think it
            has to be so limited. In my opinion, a place of interest is simply
            one that people like going to.

            In my town, the park is a(n) (2)<span id="droppable" class="droppable ui-widget-header"></span> because many people
            love spending time there. Old people do (3)<span id="droppable" class="droppable ui-widget-header"></span> and walk
            in the park. Children play games there while their parents sit
            and talk with each other. Another place of interest in my town
            is Hoa Binh market. It’s a(n) (4)<span id="droppable" class="droppable ui-widget-header"></span> market with a lot of
            things to see. I love to go there to buy food and clothes, and
            watch other people buying and selling. Foreign tourists also
            like this market because they can experience the (5)<span id="droppable" class="droppable ui-widget-header"></span>
            of Vietnamese people, and buy woven cloth and other
            (6)<span id="droppable" class="droppable ui-widget-header"></span> as souvenirs.
